# MHGU-HD-Editor
Options for MHGU HD mod made by a monke

Point it to an extracted main.zip from monke's HD mod, choose some options, and hit apply. If there should be more options let me know.

As with most of my stuff this requires some runtime to work. If you don't have it from one of my other projects I have an installer with runtime here: Link here if it ever uploads in this epoch.
